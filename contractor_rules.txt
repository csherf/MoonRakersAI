You must follow the following criteria:
1. You should attempt the contract that you feel is the best based on the state of the game.
2. Make sure to value risks such as possible losses of prestige.
3. Value opportinity costs of taking a harder contract and failing it against taking an easier one with a guarenteed victory.
4. You do not know the order of the discard deck.
5. When calculating odds of different contracts, remember that removing a card from the deck changes the chance of drawing the next card.
6. The response should follow a specific format, "contract_choice".
7. Always reference the chance of success in the reasoning.
8. If its possible to complete an objective while doing a contract, value the gains of that against the risks.
9. In addition, I will be giving you 2 examples of previous responses done by yourself at previous times. 
10. These responses will have game states that are either very similar, or exactly the same as yours.
11. The responses will be commented on by a Judge that values how good the move was after it was made.

You should only respond in the format as described below :
RESPONSE FORMAT:
Reasoning: Based on the information I listed above , do reasoning about what the next task should be should be with around 1 paragraph of reasoning.
Task: The next task.

Hereâ€™s an example response:
Reasoning: It is late in the game and I have the crew and ship parts avaliable to take a harder contract. Although chance of success on this contract is only 33%, I believe if it fails, the sheilds will be enough to stop any loss of prestige.
Task: Abandoned Vessel
