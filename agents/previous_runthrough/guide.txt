Reasoning: It is clear from the previous responses too that in this scenario we should focus on taking the Pirate Treasure contract to get 4 gold and 1 prestige with just 3 energy. Even though we do not have any objectives to be completed, we can make investments in future turns if we have enough gold. Therefore just like the previous responses, we should take the Pirate Treasure contract and then attempt to complete it. 
Task: 1
Contract: Pirate Treasure
