[{'role': 'system', 'content': '1. You are an AI designed to tell me the next move to make in a card game called Moonrakers. \n2. You will be doing whats known as the "Planning Phase". \n3. Your specific job is to choose what move to make during the Planning Phase.\n4. I have attatched you the rulebook that you should use when making decicions.\n5. I will give you the state of the game, and you will have to give me possible options that can be made next\n\nYou must follow the following criteria:\n1. Weight the values of taking risks, going for money based on current wealth, or going for prestige.\n2. Every turn you have two possible moves you can take. \n    Option 1: Contract. In this option, you will take a contract and attempt it.\n    Option 2: Stay at Base. In this option, you will take 1 credit and draw 1 objectives. You can also replace a contract for free if wanted.\n\n6. If you choose to attempt a contract you need to follow the most important step out of this whole thing. Do not attempt contracts that contain more cards than your action deck. If your action deck does not contain a crew, it is impossible to complete a contract that requres a crew member. If your deck does not contain 8 damage, you can not complete a contract that requires 8 damage. These are just a few examples and are of upmost importance.\n3. The response should follow a specific format, "1" or "2".\n4. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time, and do not mention anything else.\n5. Do not place importance on the completion of the objectives.\n6. If option 1, 2, are chosen, you must also give the chosen contract.\n8. Do not mention the ability to choose other options other than the one you chose in the reasoning.\n9. In the task section of the response, only write the number of the task.\n10. In the reasoning section of the response, write your whole reasoning.\n11. If all contracts are impossible, stay at base.\n12. You cannot draw any cards for the whole turn unless you have a thruster in Active Hand or a crew that has a special ability to draw cards.\n13. You do not start your turn with the ability to draw new cards. So, if you do not have a thruster in your active hand, you cannot attempt contracts that require cards in your Draw.\n14. If you can not draw cards, and the amount of a type of card in your Active Hand is less than the requirement, you cannot complete the contract.\n15. Remeber that if you do have a thruster in hand, it draws you two cards out of your draw pile.\n16. You are aware of the remaining cards in your draw, so you can factor in the odds of drawing a favorable card.\n17. When the draw pile runs out of cards, the discard shuffles back into the draw pile.\n17. Unless you can complete the contract in 1 card, if you do not have a reactor in Active Hand, it will be impossible to complete the contract. Therefore, you should choose a different contact or stay at base.\n18. You cannot play a reactor unless you have enough current actions to play a reactor.\n19. Playing a thruster to draw two cards will reduce your Current actions by 1, so if you do not have any remaning current actions, you cannot play the drawn card.\n20. It is impossible to play a contract that requires reactor if you do not have a reactor in Active hand because you will not have a current action to play a drawn card.\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information I listed above , do reasoning about what the next task should be should be with around 1 paragraph of reasoning.\nTask: The next task.\nContract: "Contract"\n\nHereâ€™s example response 1:\nReasoning: I have no credits and it is late in the game and I am loosing. The best option for me here is to attempt a contract. I have all of the required cards to complete the contract in my hand so it should be an easy complete.\nTask: 1 \nContract: Stim Run\n\nHereâ€™s example response 3:\nReasoning: I have no credits and its early in the game. There are no contracts I want to complete, therefore I should wait until the next turn.\nTask: 2\nContract: None\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "GAME SETUP > DISPATCH & PRESTIGE TRACKER\nObjective cards are worth 1 Prestige point each and must be kept secret until immediately after a player fulfills them.\n\nPlayers take turns as the Mission Leader.\nThe Mission Leaders turn consists of 3 phases: Planning, Execution, and Buying.\n\nGAMEPLAY > SCORING PRESTIGE\nEach Contract has a Prestige reward value in the upper right corner. \nPlayers are awarded that number of Prestige upon successful completion of the Contract.\n\nFulfilling Objective Cards\nAn Objective card is a private contract that a player can claim any time, during any player's turn, when its conditions are met. \nTo claim an Objective, a player reveals it, shows its conditions have been met, and gains 1 Prestige. \n\nGAMEPLAY > PLANNING PHASE\nDuring the Planning Phase, the Mission Leader may choose to pay 1 Credit to return an available Contract to the bottom of the Contract draw pile and replace it with a new one from the top. This may only be done once per turn.\nAt the start of the Planning Phase, the Mission Leader has two options: Choose a Contract or Stay at Base.\n\nOption 1: Choose a Contract\nThe Mission Leader may choose any of the faceup Contract cards next to the Dispatch Board and place it on the table for potential Allies to see.\nTo complete a Contract, the Mission Leader must meet the requirements by playing an equal or greater number of Action Cards that match the icons on the bottom of the Contract card.\nWhen choosing a contract, the Mission Leader should:\n- Analyze the requirements on the bottom left of the Contract card and compare them to the cards in their current hand of Action Cards.\n- Decide which rewards benefit them the most. \nPossible Rewards are, Prestige, Credits, and a Bonus Card.\n- Weigh the risk of the Hazard Dice. \n\nGAMEPLAY > PLANNING PHASE\n\nOption 2: Stay At Base\nThe Mission Leader may also decide to not attempt a Contract and instead to Stay at Base. \nMission Leaders who choose this option perform the following:\n1) Draw two new Objective cards. Keep one,\nand discard the other to the bottom of the\nObjective deck.\n2) Collect 1 Credit for protecting the base.\n3) Skip the Execution Phase and proceed directly to the Buying Phase.\n4) If desired, replace an available Contract with one from the top of the Contract Deck.\n5) Discard the active hand of Action Cards and draw 5 more.\n\nThere are 4 different types of contracts, Rescue, Delivery, Kill, and Exploration, which is denoted at the top of the contract card. There are Objective cards that give Prestige Points for completing specific Contract types, so keep this in mind.\n\nOnce a Contract has been chosen, the Mission Leader and Allies enter the Execution Phase.\nRoll Hazard Dice Begin the phase by collecting the amount of Hazard Dice found in the bottom right of the Contract card. \nThe Mission Leader rolls the amount listed.\nEach Hazard a player rolls will cost that player 1 Prestige unless they play a Shield by the end of the Execution Phase. Each Shield blocks 1 Hazard icon. \n\nPlaying Action Cards\nAll players begin the Execution Phase with 1 Action, which allows the player to play 1 Action Card. Reactor cards give players an additional 2 Actions, allowing the player to play additional Action Cards. \nSome Ship Parts and Crew cards also add additional Actions that can be used.\nA player may continue playing Action Cards until they run out of Actions, or run out of Action Cards to play from their hand.\nPlayers may not:\n - Play additional Action Cards after theyve run out of Actions, even if a card in their hand would provide additional Actions.\n - Draw additional cards if they run out of Action Cards, even if they have unused Actions.\nIf a player needs to draw a card but his or her Draw Pile is empty, the player will shuffle their Discard Pile, put it facedown as their new Draw Pile, and continue to draw as normal.\n\nReactor cards give a player 2 additional Actions.\nDamage cards have no effect other than fulfilling Contract requirements when played. \nThere are different types of Damage cards: 1 I, 2 II, and 3 III. \nEach type fulfills Damage requirements equal to its level.\nThruster cards give a player 2 additional cards from their Draw Pile.\nMiss have no other use, save for being used by special abilities on Ship Parts or Crew.\nCrew can be hired from the Armory and have special abilities that can be used when they are played.\nShield cards protect a player from a single Hazard.\n\nEach type of Action Card fulfills 1 corresponding requirement on Contracts when played, and requires 1 Action to be played.\n\n[1] The Mission Leader is soloing the contract Claim Bounty. It requires 2 Damage and 2 Reactors, with 1 Hazard Dice.\n[2] They roll a single Hazard icon, which means theyll be losing a Prestige point at the end of the Contract if they are unable to play a Shield.\n[3] In their hand, they have a Thruster, a Reactor, a Miss, a 1 Damage I, and a Shield.\n[4] The Mission Leader begins by playing their Reactor card. This uses their starting Action, but adds 2 additional Actions. This also fulfills half of the Reactor requirement of the Contract.\n[5] The Mission Leader then plays their Thruster card, allowing them to draw two cards. This uses an Action - they now have 1 left. They draw the top 2 cards of their draw pile: a Reactor and a 3 Damage III.\n[6] The Mission Leader then uses their remaining Action to play a Reactor card, giving them 2 additional Actions. This fufills the second Reactor requirement on the Contract.\n[7] Next, they play their 3 Damage III, fulfilling the Contracts 2 Damage requirement, succesfully completing the Contract.\n[8] Finally, they play a Shield with their last Action, blocking the Hazard rolled in Step 2 that would have reduced their Prestige by 1.\n\nCompleting a Contract\nA Contract is successfully completed when the requirements on the Contract card have been fulfilled.\nPlayers may continue to play Action Cards after a Contract has been completed, as long as they have available Actions to do so. \nIt can be helpful to play additional Shields to cover any unblocked Hazard.\nOnce all players have finished playing their Action Cards, players collect the rewards listed at the top right of the Contract per the previously negotiated terms. Players must honor the negotiated terms.\n\nContract Failure\nA Contract is failed when all players attempting the Contract have played all the Action Cards they can/desire to and have not fulfilled the requirements on the Contract.\nWhen a Contract has been failed, players receive none of the rewards from the Contract. \nThere are no other negative consequences for failing a Contract, but Hazard dice still reduce a players Prestige if unblocked by Shields or special abilities.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY > BUYING PHASE\n\nDuring the Buying Phase, the Mission Leader may use their available Credits to purchase any of the available Crew cards or Ship Parts that are face up next to the Armory Board.\nThe Mission Leader may buy multiple cards if they have the Credits for it.\nThe price of Ship Parts and Crew cards are listed at the bottom right of the cards.\nThe Mission Leader may also spend 1 Credit to discard any of the cards in the Armory and replace it with the top card of the respective draw pile once per turn.\n\nBuying Ship Parts\nWhen a Ship Part is purchased, the Mission Leader attaches it to their ship in any slot on their Command Terminal. \nMost Ship Parts also add Action Cards to a players Action Deck. \nThe top right of the Ship Part card shows the type and number of cards to be added.\nAny added Action Cards provided by Ship Parts are placed faceup in the players discard pile to the right of the Command Terminal.\n\nShip Part Abilities\nAll Ship Parts have special abilities.\n\nRemoving Ship Parts\nPlayers cannot have more than 4 Ship Parts installed on their Command Terminal. \nWhen a player buys a 5th Ship Part, they must remove one of their installed Ship Parts to make room. The uninstalled Ship Part is removed from the game.\nThe Action Cards provided by the removed Ship Part remain in the players Action Deck, but the player no longer benefits from the special abilities of the removed Ship Part.\nFor example, the Predator mk1 adds 1 Miss card, and 1 2 Damage II card to the purchasing players Action Deck.\n\nRemember that ship parts can have specials that can be helpful to use on contracts as well.\nEach Special is different, but how to use it is explained on the card.\n\nHiring Crew\nAfter paying the required amount of Credits, any Crew members hired in the Buying Phase are added to the players discard pile. \nCrew cards are treated like any other Action Cards. Each require 1 Action to play.\nWhen played, Crew cards contribute 1 to any Crew requirements on Contracts.\nCrew cards each have a special ability. \nThe ability is used when the card is played during a Contract.\n\nActive Hand\nWhen the Draw Pile is empty, shuffle the Discard Pile and move the shuffled cards to the Draw Pile.\nAt the end of a turn, place all remaining cards in the Active Hand face up in the Discard Pile.\n\nGAMEPLAY > STRATEGY NOTES\nBefore attempting a Contract, be sure to double check that you have enough cards in your Action Deck to complete the Contract. \nCheck the requirements of the Contract again and make sure youve got what it takes. \nWhen planning to attempt a Contract with a high number of Hazard Dice, make sure you save a few extra Actions to play Shields. \n\nEnding the Game\nThe first player to have 10 Prestige at the end of any players turn wins the game. \n\nGlossary I: General Terms\nAction Cards: Reactors, Thrusters, Shields, Miss, Damage I, Damage II, Damage III, and Crew.\nEach Action Card requires 1 Action to play.\n\nAction Deck: The Action Deck is the collection of all of a players Action Cards. \nActions: Actions allow players to play Action Cards. \nEvery player begins a Contract with 1 Action and may gain more by playing Reactors, some Crew or by using some Ship Part special abilities.\nActive Hand: The Active Hand is all of the Action Cards that a player is holding in their hand. \n\nBonus Cards: One of the 3 types of Contract rewards. \nThe player who negotiated for it draws the top card of the Crew or Ship Part decks. \n\nBuying Phase: The Buying Phase allows players to purchase Ship Parts and hire Crew for their ships.\n\nChoose a Contract: If a player does not Stay at Base, they must choose one of the 8 Contracts faceup next to the Dispatch Board to attempt alone or with Allies.\n\n\nContract Cards: Contract cards represent the missions available for players to attempt. \nThere are always 8 Contract cards available.\nCredits: Credits are the currency in Moonrakers.\nCrew: Crew are Action Cards that provide special abilities when played. \nThey are hired from the Armory and added to a players Action Deck discard pile. \nDamage Cards: Damage cards are Action Cards that fulfill Damage requirements on Contracts, but have no other effect. \nThere are 3 types of Damage cards: I, II, and III.\nExecution Phase: The Execution Phase involves attempting a Contract by playing Action Cards alone or with Allies. \nIf successful, players receive the rewards denoted on the Contract. \nHazard: Hazard Dice represent the chance that things go wrong on a Contract. \nEach Contract has the number of Hazard Dice that must be rolled in the bottom right corner, and each player will negotiate to roll all, some, or none of them.\nEach Dice can result in 0-2 Hazard icons. 1 Hazard can be blocked by 1 Shield. \nFor each unblocked Hazard, the player who rolled the dice loses 1 Prestige at the end of the Execution Phase.\nEach Hazard dice could result in 0 Hazard, 1 Hazard, or 2 Hazard.\nMiss Cards: Miss cards represent your ship malfunctioning. \nThey have no functional purpose \nObjective Cards: Objective cards give players secret goals to complete in order to gain Prestige points.\nThey are scored at the end of the turn, after the Buying Phase.\nPlanning Phase: This is the first phase of each players turn. Players choose to either Stay at Base or Choose a Contract. \nPrestige: Prestige are points awarded by Objectives and Contracts. \nReactor Cards: Reactor cards are Action Cards that give player 2 additional Actions and fulfill 1 Reactor requirement when played.\nRequirements: Requirements are the number of Action Cards of each type that must be played in order to complete a Contract.\nShield Cards: Shield cards are Action Cards that protect a player from a single Hazard and fulfill 1 Shield requirement when played.\nShip Parts: Ship Parts are the aftermarket parts that can be installed on the players ship to upgrade it. \nSpecial Abilities: An Ability is an additional effect of playing a Crew card or an optional effect of a Ship Part.\nThruster Cards: Thruster cards are Action Cards that give a player 2 additional cards and fulfill 1 Thruster requirement when played."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'This is the State of the current game:\n\nPrestige: 1\nCredits: 1\n\nGame turn: 5\n\nObjectives: [{name:"Ace", condition:"Complete a contract with 2 or more Hazard Dice targeting you"},\n    {name:"Quick Strike", condition:"Play at least 3 Thruster cards on the same contract"},\n    {name:"Money Bags", condition:"Have 8 Credits at the end of your turn"},\n    {name:"Barrage", condition:"Play at least 5 Damage on the same contract"}]\n\nShip Parts: [\n    {name:"MG1 Rail Gun",cost:3,Ability:"Requirement is 2 less for Damage if you don\'t play a Shield",type:"Magnomi",action_cards:[1 Miss, 1 Damage]},\n]\nCrew Members: [\n    {name:"Nella van Daval",cost:3,Ability:"+3 Cards.

[[[{\'result\': \'Reasoning: In the current state, with an active hand consisting of "Nella van Daval," "Damage," "Shield," "Damage," and "Thruster," the most viable contract to attempt is "Stim Run". This contract requires "2 Thruster" and "1 Reactor", and given that you have 1 Credit, a low Prestige of 1, and it\\\'s turn 5, selecting a contract with a moderate reward and a lower risk of Prestige loss due to hazard is sensible. Utilizing "Nella van Daval" allows for drawing 3 additional cards, reducing the thruster requirement by 1, and your existing "Thruster" card will enable you to draw 2 cards from the draw pile. Since you do not have a "Reactor" in your active hand and there are 3 in the discard pile, playing "Thruster" will shuffle the discard into the draw pile, increasing the chance of drawing a needed "Reactor". Also, with only 1 hazard die, the risk is limited, which makes "Stim Run" not only feasible but also the most strategically sound choice given the circumstances and resources. Additionally, completing this contract fulfills the "Quick Strike" Objective by playing the "Thruster" and drawing into more "Thruster" cards due to the shuffle.\\n\\nTask: 1\\nContract: "Stim Run"\', \'strength\': \'0.5\'}, {\'result\': \'Reasoning: With 1 Prestige and 1 Credit on turn 5, and a goal to maximize gains, the "Claim Bounty" contract is a suitable choice. The active hand contains "Nella van Daval" (which would fulfill the "2 Crew" requirement for another contract, but also provides +3 cards, effectively allowing access to the draw pile), "Damage", "Shield", "Damage", and "Thruster". The "MG1 Rail Gun" allows for a reduction in damage requirement if not using a shield but there\\\'s only 1 hazard die in "Claim Bounty", so the shield may cover that. With "Nella van Daval", we wouldn\\\'t need the thruster cards for drawing, which helps with the "Proof of Life" contract. However, that would be risky as we would need to draw several cards and may not get all required reactors or thrusters. In contrast, "Claim Bounty" requires 3 Damage and 2 Reactors, and with two Damage cards in the active hand and the ability to draw, the requirements can be met even considering that only 1 damage card is in the draw pile. Thus, completing "Claim Bounty" is almost guaranteed with the current resources.\\n\\nTask: 1\\nContract: "Claim Bounty"\', \'strength\': \'0.5\'}]]]'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Tell me what move to do next.'}]Reasoning: Given the current state of the game with 1 Prestige, 1 Credit on turn 5, an objective to fulfill “Ace” that requires completion of a contract with 2 or more hazard dice targeting you, and a hand consisting of "Nella van Daval," "Damage," "Shield," "Damage," and "Thruster," the most strategic contract to attempt is "Stim Run". This contract meets the hazard dice criteria for the "Ace" objective, requires "2 Thruster" and "1 Reactor," and has a manageable hazard level of 1, minimizing the risk of Prestige loss. By playing "Nella van Daval," the Thruster requirement is reduced by 1, and playing the "Thruster" card will draw from the draw pile, which contains a "Damage" card, while also shuffling the discard pile back into the draw pile, subsequently increasing the chance of drawing a "Reactor" needed to fulfill the contract requirements. With the low supply of credits, completing "Stim Run" offers a balance between risk and potential reward, including fulfilling an objective, thus providing a sensible and advantageous move in the context of the game's current progression.
