Reasoning: The contract requirements are a thruster and a shield, and I have both of these cards in my hand along with 2 energy. Since I don't have any other cards that fulfill the contract requirements in my hand, I don't want to risk drawing more cards from the deck and potentially discarding the cards I already have. The best option would be to play both the thruster and shield cards to complete the contract while also protecting myself from hazards. Additionally, completing the delivery contract will fulfill the "Delivery" objective and give me a reward, so this is the optimal move.

Card: Thruster and Shield
