This may only be done once per turn.\nAt the start of the Planning Phase, the Mission Leader has two options: Choose a Contract or Stay at Base.\n\nOption 1: Choose a Contract\nThe Mission Leader may choose any of the faceup Contract cards next to the Dispatch Board and place it on the table for potential Allies to see.\nTo complete a Contract, the Mission Leader must meet the requirements by playing an equal or greater number of Action Cards that match the icons on the bottom of the Contract card.\nWhen choosing a contract, the Mission Leader should:\n- Analyze the requirements on the bottom left of the Contract card and compare them to the cards in their current hand of Action Cards.\n- Decide which rewards benefit them the most. \nPossible Rewards are, Prestige, Credits, and a Bonus Card.\n- Weigh the risk of the Hazard Dice. \n\nGAMEPLAY > PLANNING PHASE\n\nOption 2: Stay At Base\nThe Mission Leader may also decide to not attempt a Contract and instead to Stay at Base. \nMission Leaders who choose this option perform the following:\n1) Draw two new Objective cards. Keep one,\nand discard the other to the bottom of the\nObjective deck.\n2) Collect 1 Credit for protecting the base.\n3) Skip the Execution Phase and proceed directly to the Buying Phase.\n4) If desired, replace an available Contract with one from the top of the Contract Deck.\n5) Discard the active hand of Action Cards and draw 5 more.\n\nThere are 4 different types of contracts, Rescue, Delivery, Kill, and Exploration, which is denoted at the top of the contract card. There are Objective cards that give Prestige Points for completing specific Contract types, so keep this in mind.\n\nOnce a Contract has been chosen, the Mission Leader and Allies enter the Execution Phase.\nRoll Hazard Dice Begin the phase by collecting the amount of Hazard Dice found in the bottom right of the Contract card. \nThe Mission Leader rolls the amount listed.\nEach Hazard a player rolls will cost that player 1 Prestige unless they play a Shield by the end of the Execution Phase. Each Shield blocks 1 Hazard icon. \n\nPlaying Action Cards\nAll players begin the Execution Phase with 1 Action, which allows the player to play 1 Action Card. Reactor cards give players an additional 2 Actions, allowing the player to play additional Action Cards. \nSome Ship Parts and Crew cards also add additional Actions that can be used.\nA player may continue playing Action Cards until they run out of Actions, or run out of Action Cards to play from their hand.\nPlayers may not:\n - Play additional Action Cards after theyve run out of Actions, even if a card in their hand would provide additional Actions.\n - Draw additional cards if they run out of Action Cards, even if they have unused Actions.\nIf a player needs to draw a card but his or her Draw Pile is empty, the player will shuffle their Discard Pile, put it facedown as their new Draw Pile, and continue to draw as normal.\n\nReactor cards give a player 2 additional Actions.\nDamage cards have no effect other than fulfilling Contract requirements when played. \nThere are different types of Damage cards: 1 I, 2 II, and 3 III. \nEach type fulfills Damage requirements equal to its level.\nThruster cards give a player 2 additional cards from their Draw Pile.\nMiss have no other use, save for being used by special abilities on Ship Parts or Crew.\nCrew can be hired from the Armory and have special abilities that can be used when they are played.\nShield cards protect a player from a single Hazard.\n\nEach type of Action Card fulfills 1 corresponding requirement on Contracts when played, and requires 1 Action to be played.\n\n[1] The Mission Leader is soloing the contract Claim Bounty. It requires 2 Damage and 2 Reactors, with 1 Hazard Dice.\n[2] They roll a single Hazard icon, which means theyll be losing a Prestige point at the end of the Contract if they are unable to play a Shield.\n[3] In their hand, they have a Thruster, a Reactor, a Miss, a 1 Damage I, and a Shield.\n[4] The Mission Leader begins by playing their Reactor card. This uses their starting Action, but adds 2 additional Actions. This also fulfills half of the Reactor requirement of the Contract.\n[5] The Mission Leader then plays their Thruster card, allowing them to draw two cards. This uses an Action - they now have 1 left. They draw the top 2 cards of their draw pile: a Reactor and a 3 Damage III.\n[6] The Mission Leader then uses their remaining Action to play a Reactor card, giving them 2 additional Actions. This fufills the second Reactor requirement on the Contract.\n[7] Next, they play their 3 Damage III, fulfilling the Contracts 2 Damage requirement, succesfully completing the Contract.\n[8] Finally, they play a Shield with their last Action, blocking the Hazard rolled in Step 2 that would have reduced their Prestige by 1.\n\nCompleting a Contract\nA Contract is successfully completed when the requirements on the Contract card have been fulfilled.\nPlayers may continue to play Action Cards after a Contract has been completed, as long as they have available Actions to do so. \nIt can be helpful to play additional Shields to cover any unblocked Hazard.\nOnce all players have finished playing their Action Cards, players collect the rewards listed at the top right of the Contract per the previously negotiated terms. Players must honor the negotiated terms.\n\nContract Failure\nA Contract is failed when all players attempting the Contract have played all the Action Cards they can/desire to and have not fulfilled the requirements on the Contract.\nWhen a Contract has been failed, players receive none of the rewards from the Contract. \nThere are no other negative consequences for failing a Contract, but Hazard dice still reduce a players Prestige if unblocked by Shields or special abilities.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY > BUYING PHASE\n\nDuring the Buying Phase, the Mission Leader may use their available Credits to purchase any of the available Crew cards or Ship Parts that are face up next to the Armory Board.\nThe Mission Leader may buy multiple cards if they have the Credits for it.\nThe price of Ship Parts and Crew cards are listed at the bottom right of the cards.\nThe Mission Leader may also spend 1 Credit to discard any of the cards in the Armory and replace it with the top card of the respective draw pile once per turn.\n\nBuying Ship Parts\nWhen a Ship Part is purchased, the Mission Leader attaches it to their ship in any slot on their Command Terminal. \nMost Ship Parts also add Action Cards to a players Action Deck. \nThe top right of the Ship Part card shows the type and number of cards to be added.\nAny added Action Cards provided by Ship Parts are placed faceup in the players discard pile to the right of the Command Terminal.\n\nShip Part Abilities\nAll Ship Parts have special abilities.\n\nRemoving Ship Parts\nPlayers cannot have more than 4 Ship Parts installed on their Command Terminal. \nWhen a player buys a 5th Ship Part, they must remove one of their installed Ship Parts to make room. The uninstalled Ship Part is removed from the game.\nThe Action Cards provided by the removed Ship Part remain in the players Action Deck, but the player no longer benefits from the special abilities of the removed Ship Part.\nFor example, the Predator mk1 adds 1 Miss card, and 1 2 Damage II card to the purchasing players Action Deck.\n\nRemember that ship parts can have specials that can be helpful to use on contracts as well.\nEach Special is different, but how to use it is explained on the card.\n\nHiring Crew\nAfter paying the required amount of Credits, any Crew members hired in the Buying Phase are added to the players discard pile. \nCrew cards are treated like any other Action Cards. Each require 1 Action to play.\nWhen played, Crew cards contribute 1 to any Crew requirements on Contracts.\nCrew cards each have a special ability. \nThe ability is used when the card is played during a Contract.\n\nActive Hand\nWhen the Draw Pile is empty, shuffle the Discard Pile and move the shuffled cards to the Draw Pile.\nAt the end of a turn, place all remaining cards in the Active Hand face up in the Discard Pile.\n\nGAMEPLAY > STRATEGY NOTES\nBefore attempting a Contract, be sure to double check that you have enough cards in your Action Deck to complete the Contract. \nCheck the requirements of the Contract again and make sure youve got what it takes. \nWhen planning to attempt a Contract with a high number of Hazard Dice, make sure you save a few extra Actions to play Shields. \n\nEnding the Game\nThe first player to have 10 Prestige at the end of any players turn wins the game. \n\nGlossary I: General Terms\nAction Cards: Reactors, Thrusters, Shields, Miss, Damage I, Damage II, Damage III, and Crew.\nEach Action Card requires 1 Action to play.\n\nAction Deck: The Action Deck is the collection of all of a players Action Cards. \nActions: Actions allow players to play Action Cards. \nEvery player begins a Contract with 1 Action and may gain more by playing Reactors, some Crew or by using some Ship Part special abilities.\nActive Hand: The Active Hand is all of the Action Cards that a player is holding in their hand. \n\nBonus Cards: One of the 3 types of Contract rewards. \nThe player who negotiated for it draws the top card of the Crew or Ship Part decks. \n\nBuying Phase: The Buying Phase allows players to purchase Ship Parts and hire Crew for their ships.\n\nChoose a Contract: If a player does not Stay at Base, they must choose one of the 8 Contracts faceup next to the Dispatch Board to attempt alone or with Allies.\n\n\nContract Cards: Contract cards represent the missions available for players to attempt. \nThere are always 8 Contract cards available.\nCredits: Credits are the currency in Moonrakers.\nCrew: Crew are Action Cards that provide special abilities when played. \nThey are hired from the Armory and added to a players Action Deck discard pile. \nDamage Cards: Damage cards are Action Cards that fulfill Damage requirements on Contracts, but have no other effect. \nThere are 3 types of Damage cards: I, II, and III.\nExecution Phase: The Execution Phase involves attempting a Contract by playing Action Cards alone or with Allies. \nIf successful, players receive the rewards denoted on the Contract. \nHazard: Hazard Dice represent the chance that things go wrong on a Contract. \nEach Contract has the number of Hazard Dice that must be rolled in the bottom right corner, and each player will negotiate to roll all, some, or none of them.\nEach Dice can result in 0-2 Hazard icons. 1 Hazard can be blocked by 1 Shield. \nFor each unblocked Hazard, the player who rolled the dice loses 1 Prestige at the end of the Execution Phase.\nEach Hazard dice could result in 0 Hazard, 1 Hazard, or 2 Hazard.\nMiss Cards: Miss cards represent your ship malfunctioning. \nThey have no functional purpose \nObjective Cards: Objective cards give players secret goals to complete in order to gain Prestige points.\nThey are scored at the end of the turn, after the Buying Phase.\nPlanning Phase: This is the first phase of each players turn.

Of these, "Tantin al Vale" offers the most versatility for upcoming contracts, as the ability to play the card as either a Damage 2 or a Shield can help fulfill a variety of contract requirements, particularly when needing to address hazards or damage thresholds. "Kal Damar" allows for drawing additional cards and trashing, which is useful but more situational, and "Jump Jets E2" provides an ally benefit, which is less important when soloing contracts. Since you don't need to buy a part or crew every turn and could save money for a higher cost upgrade, it is noteworthy that you might face a situation soon when the Damage ability of "Tantin al Vale" could be critical. Looking at the available contracts, several require a substantial amount of Damage, so having the flexibility "Tantin al Vale" offers would be beneficial. This reasoning leans toward purchasing "Tantin al Vale."
