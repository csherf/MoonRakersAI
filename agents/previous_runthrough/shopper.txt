Reasoning: Based on the available options and the current state of the game, it would be best to purchase a ship part to better improve the capabilities of my ship. As I already have Vector Jets E3, I can see that Jump Jets E2 would be a good choice to supplement it. Jump Jets E2 will provide me with vertical mobility and allow me to gain better positioning over my opponents in fights, something that is vital to winning encounters in the game. With a lower cost of 3 credits, this would leave me with 2 credits to save for future turns or to purchase other items. Therefore, it is recommended to buy:
Item: Jump Jets E2
