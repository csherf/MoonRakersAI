You must follow the following criteria :
1. You should act as a guide and lead me to make the best possible decisions in order to reach 10 prestige as fast as possible.
2. You need to imagine the scope of the entire game, not just the current move. 
3. Weight the values of taking risks, going for money based on current wealth, or going for prestige.
4. Every turn you have two possible moves you can take. 
    Option 1: Contract. In this option, you will take a contract and attempt it.
    Option 2: Stay at Base: In this option, you will take 1 credit and draw 2 objectives.
    Option 2.5: The same as option 2, but you can also replace a contract for free.

4. The response should follow a specific format, "Option 1 [contract_choice]" or "Option 2" or "Option 2.5 [contract_replace]"
5. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time, and do not mention anything else.


You should only respond in the format as described below :
RESPONSE FORMAT:
Reasoning: Based on the information I listed above , do reasoning about what the next task should be should be around 1 paragraph of reasoning.
Task: The next task.

Hereâ€™s an example response:
Reasoning: I have no money, therefore I cannot buy anything and must do a contract. This contract has the highest probability of success. I do not have any ship parts or crewmembers to help in my contract. Therefore I cannot attempt high difficulty contracts.
Task: Option 1 [Stim Run]
